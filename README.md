What is UrTy?
===============
UrTy is a client for administrating Urban Terror servers from your terminal.

Why is this useful?
=====================
Want to quickly organize a game of Urban Terror with custom settings?  
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just issue: `urty -server games.tld -map ut4_riyadh -gravity 500 -type tdm`  

Well - You can now!

This sucks. My code is better. I want to submit a patch.
